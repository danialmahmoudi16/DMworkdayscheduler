A simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.

# Exercise
Tasked with creating a simple calendar application thath allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. 
A starter code was provided for this assignment "Day.js" and the objective of having events saved in local storage were done by:

- firsty duplicating / adding in all divs from hour 9 to hour 17 of the schedule planner within the index.html file
- Then getting to the script.js file, creating a variable and using dayjs format to apply the current date at the header of the page.
- using a function and click event to activate the save button for the user to save their input into the local storage.
- Then use the time block class to apply the past, future, and present to each time block.
- Finally, create a function and place a for loop within it to store the user input by declaring the id hour and the description.
